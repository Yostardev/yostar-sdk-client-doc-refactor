AiriSDK (SDK) is mainly targeted to provide third-party applications with convenient login and payment services for players from overseas. This document demonstrates the usage of the API-related functions to allow Unity developers gain smooth access of the SDK.


This document is written for developers with a certain level of Unity development experience and a fundamental knowledge of Android packaging.

To give developers a better understanding of our SDK, we provide game developers with a Sequence Diagram for login and payment.
